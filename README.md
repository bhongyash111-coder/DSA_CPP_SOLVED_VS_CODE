# DSA CPP Solved VS Code

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems and concepts implemented in C++.

> **Note**: All the code in this repository was written entirely by me during my second year of college. This collection represents my personal practice and learning journey before I was introduced to platforms like LeetCode.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized into various categories based on the topic:

- **Basics**: Fundamental concepts and pattern printing problems.
- **Arrays**: Problems related to 1D and 2D arrays.
- **Recursion**: Recursive solutions and concepts.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge) and searching techniques (Linear, Binary).
- **Strings**: String manipulation problems.
- **Pointers**: Concepts and examples of pointers in C++.
- **Linked List**: Implementation and problems related to Linked Lists.
- **Stack**: Stack implementation and related problems.
- **OOPs**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.).
- **Tree**: Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST).
- **Vectors**: Usage of the `std::vector` container.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the files locally:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhongyash111-coder/DSA_CPP_SOLVED_VS_CODE.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd DSA_CPP_SOLVED_VS_CODE
    ```
3.  Compile and run a C++ file (e.g., Bubble Sort):
    ```bash
    g++ "SORTING&Searching_ALGO/BUBBLE_SORT.CPP" -o bubble_sort
    ./bubble_sort
    ```
